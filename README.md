# DoonCraft-Distance

### THIS MODPACK AND SOME INCLUDED MODS ARE VERY EXPERIMENTAL. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND BACKUP YOUR WORLDS.

This modpack will eventually aim to provide all the features and QOL changes of [DoonCraft Vanilla+](https://modrinth.com/modpack/dooncraft-vanilla) while also offering the Distant Horizons mod. This modpack is currently and will remain a client-side modpack.

As far as I can tell you do need a good CPU in order for chunks to render properly. Things went fine on my desktop but my laptop would not load chunks nicely no matter the settings.

The Distant Horizons config has also been tweaked to offer what I find to be the best quality/performance ratio and seems to support multiplayer servers properly.
